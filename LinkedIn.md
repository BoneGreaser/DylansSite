### Some ask me "Dylan what do you want to do in the future?"

Frankly other than working a normal job I still want to get rich and creating a video game or application is one of the best paths I see ahead for myself with my many good ideas.

To show off my amazing coding skills I've posted some advanced code below that performs advanced mathematical calculations.

***

daily = float(input('Daily Hours Worked:')) #hours worked daily

wage = float(input('Hourly Wage:')) #hourly wage

x = float((daily * wage) * 365)

print('Yearly Wage:', x)
